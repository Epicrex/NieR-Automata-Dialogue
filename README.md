# A Beautiful Performance (Episode XIX)

<i>Look at me.</i><br>
<i>Oh please look at me.</i><br>
<i>I want your eyes to look upon me alone.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Have I not become beautiful?</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>Do these clothes make me look cute?<br>
<i>Would he like it if I walked like this?</i><br>
<br>
<i>I still don't understand what it means to love someone.</i><br>
<i>But I've made up my mind.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I will do whatever it takes to capture his affection.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>Long ago, an old machine lifeform told me something:</i><br>
<i>"Beauty is what wins love."</i><br>
<br>
<i>But what is "beauty"?</i><br>
<i>After researching the old world, I finally learned the truth.</i><br>
<i></i>Beauty is pretty skin.<br>
<i></i>Beauty is stylish accessories.<br>
<i></i>Beauty is looking one's best.<br>
<br>
<i>I will become beautiful. I will do it for him.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>I once heard tell of a precious jewel far to the east.</i><br>
<i>It was said to be located on a terribly dangerous mountain.</i><br>
<i>But I did not care.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I slipped on cliffs. I fell onto rocks. But eventually I claimed the jewel.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Blue stone. Brilliant blue. So beautiful.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I lost many parts obtaining this jewel. I lost...myself.</i><br>
<br>
<i>But my wounds are badges.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>There's a rumor floating among the other machine lifeforms lately:</i><br>
<i>"Devour the body of an android to gain eternal beauty.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Such nonsense.</i><br>
<i>It is physically impossible to obtain beauty by consuming an android.</i><br>
<br>
<i>But I tried anyway.</i><br>
<i>I would try anything.</i><br>
<i>I wanted to vomit, but I kept going.</i><br>
<i>It tasted like oil.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>Not a moment passed where I didn't strive to become more beautiful.</i><br>
<i>But he still won't look my way.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I even tried to learn what is called a "song."</i><br>
<i>Songs can make someone have feelings for you.</i><br>
<i>That's what they say.</i><br>
<i>So I practiced every day.</i><br>
<i>But he still won't look my way.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I ate more androids. I even ate machine lifeforms.</i><br>
<i>But he still won't look my way.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>He won't look my way.</i><br>
<i>He won't look my way.</i><br>
<i>He won't look my way.</i><br>
<i>He won't look my way.</i><br>
<i>He won't look my way.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Won't look my way won't look my way won't look my way won't look my way won't
look my way won't look my way won't look my way won't look my way won't look my
way won't look my way won't look my way won't look my way won't look my way</i><br>
<br>
<i>He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;won't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>That's when I realized he cares not for jewels.</i><br>
<i>Or songs or beauty or appearance or anything else.</i><br>
<i>I cannot win his love.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Why have I done this to myself?</i><br>
<br>
<i>Meaningless.</i><br>
<i>Meaningless.</i><br>
<i>MEANINGLESS.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I gaze into the mirror. In its reflection, I see only my own meaninglessness. And so I scream.</i><br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
<i>someone please look my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way</i><br>
<br>

- "I taught the children what fear is. I felt they had to know so they wouldn't heedlessly run into danger. But... instead..." ~ A2
- "I seek to learn and adopt all facets of humanity! Some desire love! Others family! Only then did I realize the truth...the core of humanity... is conflict. They fight. Steal. Kill. This is humanity in its purest form!" ~ one of the twins
- "We've destroyed machines beyond counting. Perhaps someone sees that as a sin." ~ 2B
- "There's an important lesson here: The more of a fool people take you for, the more you'll learn of their true nature." ~ Weird Machine
- "What is it that separates machines from androids like us? The machines have grown emotions. ...Consciousness. The final screams they summoned on the edge of their death... They still echo within me." ~ 2B
- "A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself." ~ Pod 042
- "The time I was able to spend with you. It was like memories of pure light. Thank you... Nine... s" ~ 2B

- "I never quite realized ... how beautiful this world is." ~ A2
- “Why do I long for humans like this?! Why do I desire the touch of something that no longer exists?” ~ 9S
- "Do not feel bad about it. We are alive, after all. And being alive is pretty much a constant stream of embarrassment." ~ Pod 153
- "Everything that lives is designed to end. They are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. However, life is all about the struggle within this cycle. That is what 'we' believe." ~ ending E by Pod 153
